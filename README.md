# Computational-Decipherment-and-Cross-Linguistic-Analysis-of-Linear-A-Linear-B-and-Swahili
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and compare the linguistic structures of linear A, linear B, and Swahili (modern Bantu language) using computational methods. We aim to look at the linguistic structural patterns focusing on syllabic (Linear A and Linear B) and agglutinative systems (Swahili)

#Task Management:
1. Linear A - Joslin
2. Linear B - Prince
3. Swahili - Adrian 

# Linear A/B and Swahili Decipherment
Repository for paper: "Computational Decipherment and Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Linear A, Linear B, and Swahili"
